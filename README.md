# Search Algorithms using Tkinter

## Tkinter Application for Graph Visualization and Apply Search Algorithms

The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application using the Tkinter Python library, in order to be able to create and visualize graphs, and to be able to apply and visualize search algorithms on them.

<b>The project is currently in development, but you're welcome to review its current state.</b>

### Main Page
</br>
<div align="center">
    <img width="700px" height="auto" src="Status Images/main-window.png"/>
</div>

This will be the main window where we have a left section which contains all the buttons for all the possible actions, and the right section where the graphs will be displayed. 
</br>
Currently there is a graph generated, since we have used it to test the implemented functionalities of being able to zoom in and out of the graph, and being able to move the graph by holding down the graph and moving the mouse.
